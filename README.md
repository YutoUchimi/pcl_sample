# pcl_sample

#### A very small sample package for PCL (Point Cloud Library)

## Requirements

* CUDA
* PCL 1.8.0rc2

These should be installed manually.

Download `install_cuda-8.0.sh` and `install_pcl-1.8.sh` from https://github.com/YutoUchimi/dotfiles_public/tree/master/install_scripts, and then run these scripts.

* OpenCV 2.4.8
* Eigen 3.2.0
* Boost 1.54

These libraries will be installed with `build.sh` internally.

## Compile

Simply run `build.sh`.
